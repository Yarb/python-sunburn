Sunburn Project control software repository.

Parts of this software and variations of it was used throughout the testing of the prototype solar computer system.
Currently the client and power measurement system files are not included.

Control software was intented to measure the power supply from solar panel and power usage of the client computer in an attempt to
to balance them out. 

Some history:
The control software is a derivative of my thesis work with the computer heating system, which worked in very similar fashion:
Instead of controlling the amount of energy the slaved computers use, the amount of heat generated is controlled. The method
in both is similar: Control the processor use and the power consumption can be controlled with surprising accuracy.
And in terms of computers, power translates to heat.
As the computing heater could maintain room temperatures neatly the idea of using similar system to burn away generated solar
energy was proposed and this was the end result.
